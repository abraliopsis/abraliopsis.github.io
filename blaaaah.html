<p> why hello there. <br> surely there must be a reason you were brought here.
<br> perhaps you found this randomly, though what kind of self-deprecating and coincidental internet search
would that be?
<br> perhaps this was sent to you. and you noticed how edgy it was. but curiosity lingers.
<br> perhaps you honestly don't give an actual shit, and just want to waste your time.
<br> go ahead, explore these thoughts.
<br> go ahead, explore your own as well.
