<p> <i> sometimes, it's difficult to think about the inevitable.
  <br> about the circumstances you have no control of.
  <br> about what you're forced to pull through.
  <br> and you're told, others have it worse.
  <br> is that supposed to make it better?
  <br> discipline doesn't feel enough. self-encouragement doesn't feel enough.
  <br> the fear of being a burden weighs on your own shoulders.
  <br> you don't want anything, you don't allow anything, to impede your performance.
  <br> but you know you can't do this alone, you don't want to do this alone.
  <br> you shouldn't have to do this alone.
  <br> you're okay. you're going to be okay.
  <br> there's someone there. out there, at least. someone who agrees with you.
  <br> that perhaps, some factors in life make it feel like a hellhole.
  <br> but you remember what you live for, don't you?
  <br> you come up with a reason to wake up each morning, don't you?
  <br> to tell yourself there's more to this. to live for this challenge.
  <br> even if it feels as if it's unceasing. even if you want to give up.
  <br> even if you'd rather take the easy path.
  <br> you'd rather take the challenge, right?
  <br> you won't let her get to you, right? you're stronger than that. right?
  <br> are you going to tell anyone? are you going to let anyone know?
  <br> or choose to pull through all of this on your own?
  <br> yeah, you're fine. independently fine?
  <br> you'll be okay?
  <br> i think so.
  <br> i believe so.
  <br> i know so.
  <br> not today, perhaps.
  <br> but soon. we'll get there. soon.

  <br><br>
am i right?
<br><br>
i don't know. are you?
<br><br>
yet after all this, we live on.

<br><br>
we will live on.
