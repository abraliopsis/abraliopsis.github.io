<p> dear rachel,
<br><br>
hey you.
<br> what exactly is the purpose of this, you might ask?
  <br>
  well actually i highly doubt that would be your first thought that The Mind would come up with.
    <br>well, i'm writing this because i'm hoenstly so so full of words for you right this moment?
    <br>like i have a lot of thoughts and yadayada..
    <br>there's just so much to say and the paper is so close and this pen was only a few centimetres away from my fingers.
  <br>  you're an amazing friend. you're amazing at being friend. you're amazing in general.
    <br>i really really hope that i'm seeing you for who you are and not for who my inner self wants you to be if that makes sense.
    <br>not like i'm doubting this current perspective on you, though.
    <br>i remember when we first started talking. i don't know why exactly but you decided to expose Yourself.
    <br>you just. you gave me your tumblr. i opened it. i scrolled a little. scrolled a lot.
    <br>then we talked even more to introduce ourselves to each other informally. i was able to see what you were like and what you were into, but way more lightly compared to now.
    <br>i believe the next few weeks after that were the slam poetry competition held for hullabaloo where we actually spent time with each other and i remembered it wasn't as awkward as i'd expected it to be.
    <br>you were so chill. you're still chill!! and you make yourself a safe space to be around.
    <br>i remember you'd talk about your past, who you were, and the aspects you didn't like about who you used to be.
    <br>you said that year, you focused on improving yourself and you'd strive for personal growth/ had strived/ will continue to. you cared a lot about shaping yourself into someone mature / loving to those around you. you grew up and developed an open mind.
    <br>we didn't even know each other that well then, but it was so nice to see that you were able to share those things and it made me think a lot.. how changing yourself from what you were into someone more mature, awaringly, is kind of difficult. that's what i thought, at least. like, it's not something you see in daily living, you know. takes a lot of .. strength. it's honestly -not sure if this is the right wording but -inspiring in a way that yes, we should all be trying to do that everyday. to be better maturity-wise, to be better at empathizing, to be better at being a friend.
    <br>but do we try to do that everyday??? who knows??? we'll never know.
    <br>but it's time to make an Assumptionâ„¢ and say we probably don't.
    <br>we grew so close to each other, honestly. i think we both witnessed that.
    we'd live through each other's life events / strong or not-strong, still life events.
    <br>you shared your thoughts, knowledge, passions, an open-mind whenever you were engaged in the conversation.
      <br>you stand up for people. you love others unceasingly. you know it's so obvious to see the love you have in you.
      <br>your words of affirmation for others. from you, and of course other wonderful individuals i look up to, i see so many (so so many) characteristics that i want to see in myself (and fail to see in myself) and i look up to you a lot for that.
      <br>those always up for new knowledge, for adventures, for improvement, for growth.
      <br>those who put such hard work into what they love doing.
      <br>perhaps some of these work get handed past the due date (woops),
      <br>but the work put it into is isn't some half-assed rushed thing every time.
      <br>it was so nice to see.
      <br>sometimes people would mention that you were aggressive and there were moments where i'd feel bad for not standing up for you
      <br>and sometimes i'd even agree in my head.
      <br>but what these thoughts failed to see was that you'd come off as aggressive when you'd talk about what you believe is just.
      <br>i remember being your debate partner.
      <br>we laughed and the judges probably deemed it disrespectful when we did that during the actual debate.
        <br>we've had such good times.
        <br>but i could also remember the time where we both started to drift apart and things felt so different and hard to put back together.
        <br>i know / highly doubt that any of that is from you.
        <br>our friendship felt like it was hanging on the edge of a cliff and a few more weeks would kick it off that.
        <br>and i still feel that sometimes.
      <br> like every conversation with you would probably be the last if i don't work on my personal issues as well as i should be.
  <br>i don't want to write this with clouded judgement so i'm gonna pause and chill.
    <br>you know what's weird is that you always put effort into starting conversations with your how-are-you's.
  <br>double messages. triple messages. spam. thoughts. memes.
    <br>and it would be like, sometimes. i know it probably is and it must be. it just has to be.
      <br>it has to be super draining emotionally and mentally to do something like that a lot..
    <br>especially if the person on the other end pulls away a lot. and it's like. why haven't you given up yet.
      <br>why are you still here. why am i not doing a better job at this.
    <br>i feel as if our friendship should've just fell apart.
      <br>the first few months when we began to become closer as friends i told you that my friendships didn't last very long.
  <br>which is not on them either.
    <br>and it's not a Coincidence that they don't last long.
      <br>they don't last long bc of my inability to grow up and be better at dealing with things..
    <br>and then you went on and said ours would.
      <br>i was like what the fuck @ in my head because that was a really, i know you weren't even that serious in the moment i think and maybe said it jokingly but it was like woah there?? highly doubted it at the time.
        <br>we were in different grades and didn't even have classes and all that.
          <br>had this insecure mindset of -fuck like not to be insecure or anything but i always feel that i'm not doing a good enough job as a friend and i want to do a much better job at this and i will make small steps into doing that and if i fail then so be it then it's time to start from square one again you honestly deserve better than having me as your friend-
            <br>but that insecure mindset isn't good for anything. because when i noticed that you and sarah got closer it felt so right for our friendship to stop there as you'd found that person or friend you need and deserve.
              <br>but we had that talk, and you pressed importance on communication.
                <br>i told you i would only really give you half truths. but you were like give full truths and it's like okay i'll be completely honest, which is supposed to be like the decent friendship thing to do.
                  <br>after that it started feeling safe telling you full truths. you always say to examine yourself.. i'm getting somewhere i think.
                    <br>but for sure insecurities cause the fear losses of friendships / one thing leads to another when my mind's set on that.
                      <br>meeting you was honestly a game-changer.
                        <br>there's so many things i could've just come up with myself but i had to realize them from you.
                          <br>it's so fricking weird that all of these characteristics you have that i'm striving for is like..
                          <br>what should already be there in the first place..
                          <br>but that's okay, i think. thank you for existing.
                          <br>for being. i really appreciate everything. everything about you.
                          <br>it's made a lot of difference and influence on other's lives, who you are, who you try to be, you know.
                          <br>i'm super grateful we're in each other's lives the moment i'm writing this and perhaps we may not be as much soon if anything happens.
                          <br>i hope we remain in each other's lives. but if you feel the friendship is toxic and/or isn't making you feel the way a friendship should be which is --safe, loved, cared for, listening to each other, spending quality time and expending mutual effort..
                          <br>don't stay, please because that's not worth your time and emotional energy.
                          <br>i hope for you to pull through with all your might in the next few months, or maybe just every day in general.
                          <br>it's so hard to see you as just a friend sometimes (Half-Truth) because you're honestly probably way more than that (wow that sounds a little over 70% homo (half-truth)).
                          <br>but i don't want to write this with you as a crush in mind but as you as a friend and an importance presence in this present life.
                          <br>this letter is just a letter for expressing the full truths and how much this person values you for being who you are, the influence you've had, who you were, who you are, who you will be.
                          <br>it's exciting to see. hope we spend more time with each other.
                          <br>hope we're honest with each other and share thoughts with each other.
                          <br>glad we were able to meet each other and if all things work together for good,
                          <br>hope we continue meeting each other.
                          <br>if we're being honest here i've been super lowkey highkey midkey into you these past few /months/
                          <br>but i do feel that it's kind of a weird time for these feelings.
                          <br>hope that's not something that'll stop our friendship, you know.
                          <br>and tell me about the things i could improve on to be a better friend for you.
                          <br>and when you do, i hope there's a noticeable difference seen somehow.
                          <br>through actions, behaviour, and not just words.
                          <br>if we do stop talking someday, if we grow out of each other's lives.
                          <br>well, i am still thankful we even had this opportunity to experience life together in the first place.
                          <br>wherever you go, i'm sure you'll always have your open heart and open mind with you,
                          <br>and that makes all the difference.
                          <br>you'll always be a safe space for yourself and others,
                          <br>and that makes all the difference.
                          <br>to be as loving as you are,
                          <br>and that makes all the difference.
                          <br>i hope all the same is returned to you.
                          <br>feels like there needs to be more space on this paper to continue this.
                          <br>hope i'd be able to return to you / am able to return to you the feeling of reassurance and affirmations you provide.
                          <br>there's still so much to say, about our existence, our humanity, our characters.
                          <br>so much to reflect on and so much more to learn.
                          <br>to grow into and to experience.
                          <br>i say that a lot because it is what it is.
                          <br>thank you for this journey together that we've had,
                          <br>the present journey that we have.
                          <br>the future journey we may have.
                          <br>for helping me grow into who i can be.
                          <br>i want to do the same. love you lots!
                          <br>
                          <br>sincerely,
                          <br>lovely
