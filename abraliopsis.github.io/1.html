<p> It is time to release these journal entries, I guess.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>

I believe that self-improvement has been the most effective coping mechanism I've been trying to use for the past few years.
<br> One of the reasons my motivation to continue working harder / improving in everything has strengthened is due to the major lifeturning event I call The Breakup™. <br>It's major in the aspect that isn't about how it happened during the time, but in relativity compared to my experiences in relationships, I guess. <br>My whole Grade 8 life pretty much revolved around her because I was (still am, but I embrace it more) a boring person who didn't have many interesting things going on. <br>So when our relationship ended, I didn't know what to do anymore. <br>I spent most of those times thinking of her / wanting to be with her. <br>But when a relationship ends, what are you supposed to do then? <br>My search for distractions began and I was desperate for escape. <br>I could not stay grieving over something I already fully blamed and held myself accountable for. <br>It has been exactly 814 days since my first journal entry about her and I'm back at it again! I think I'm fully moved on, but want to document how much this has affected me. <br>I distracted myself by trying to be the person I told myself I would love to be. <br>Someone involved in the community, someone with hobbies and passions, someone who works hard and gets good grades. <br>But never in my life have I actually set my mindset to believing that I have control over the type of person I would like to become.

<br> Most of the improvements I've focused on started because of the issues I had moving on. <br> I struggle a lot with feeling a lot for one person and it is unfairly hard to get rid of.
<br>I struggle so much with moving on. <br> I struggle a lot about how people have shared such fun life experiences with me, I struggle with thinking about how I'd love to start things over.
<br>But every year is a year of realizations.
<br>I may not have control over how I feel, but I will decide to be in control / in touch with my actions and behaviour.
<br>I want to be a friendlier person.
<br>Talk about myself less with others but at the same time mentioning enough to be mentally healthy.
<br>I want to recognize I extremely suck at moving on but know it is within me to not overthink things out of my control.
<br>The moment you start holding yourself accountable for the decisions you make, things feel less chaotic and more stable.
<br>When you switch your mindset and allow space for growth, allow yourself to find comfort in discomfort.
<br>Embrace hardships as opportunities to strengthen yourself, set yourself to make the right decisions that match your self-expectations and don't harm anyone, it all feels alright again.
<br>For a moment, you can feel a heavy boulder weighing you down, but you realize that this wasn't made for you to grieve over / make you think you've lost control.
<br>This boulder is here to help you get disciplined, regain control over yourself in the most difficult circumstances.
<br>It's there to make you appreciate how things used to be easier but now that you're in a situation that feels overwhelmingly heavy, then everything will feel at ease once this is over.
<br>I have learned to love the challenge.
<br>To do things that don't necessarily maximize my happiness, to test my ability in encountering discomfort.
<br>I have learned to love the process.
<br>To not hate what sucks, but love what has existed to help me, love what learning experiences I had the opportunity to endure.
<br>The emotional and mental health issues I know still linger inside of me, but I will not let it impede or weaken my performance in daily living.
<br>I will make friends with these, I will get better with these, I will use these as a source of power.
<br>To turn things opposite and contrary to what these issues are trying to get me to do.
<br>Maybe the issues didn't exist to be seen as issues.
<br>If they did, I will nevertheless transform their ability to weaken me, into an ability to strengthen me.
<br> I will go beyond my limits, always.
<br> I don't live in what I'm limited to.
<br>I must create a comfortable space for myself where I am allowing space for others to come in and receive love, care and support.
<br>In any spaces I help create, there must always be space for growth, love, learning, and new experiences.
<br>I will welcome others with an open heart.
<br>I will separate how I feel with how I decide to act.
<br>I will be more rational in my actions.
<br>Because in doing so, I am allowing myself to create a path others will want to follow.
<br> Until the snow melts, and then falls again.
<br> I exist to provide love for others.
<br>I exist to share my passions with others.
<br>I exist to engage in heartwarming conversations.
<br>I exist to be my own welcoming space for others, and myself.
<br>To share perspectives with others.
<br>To grow with others.
<br>I exist to listen with an open heart and open mind.
<br>We exist here in the universe to belong to each other and lift each other up.
<br>We exist to preserve the space created for us, to not abuse the resources she provides us.
<br>We exist to take care of her and love her.
<br>We exist to take care of each other, love each other, go through difficulties with each other, grow stronger with each other.
<br>We are here to sharpen each other-- with our wisdom, our willingness to accept what's new for us and be adaptiveto the environment that's always changing.
<br>We exist to love the process.
<br><i> We exist to help each other realize that loving yourself isn't always about doing things, but can sometimes be not doing things. </i>
<br>We exist here to help others develop a mind that loves themselves and others.
<br>We exist to recognize that our role is to not help people become who we want them to be, but who they want to be.
<br>Be there for them every step of the way.
<br>To help them be inspired to create the choices that will end up treating them well, loving them.
<br>We're here to create a loving and sharing community that caters to everyone's needs and at least help each other be comfortable in situations of discomfort.
<br>In states of inevitable circumstances.
<br>The vicissitudes of life.
<br>I would not be myself without others.
<br>You would not be yourself without others.
<br>We would not be who we are without us.
<br>We are here for each other, not against each other.
<br>We're here to recognize that some people decide to choose the latter, out of greed and hunger for power.
<br>We're here to recognize the power structures that exist in the system, the injustice of the system.
<br>We're here to love each other in our communities and hold on to each other, no matter the circumstances.
<br>So, see the best in yourself.
<br>See the best in them.
<br>Bring out the best in yourself.
<br>Bring out the best in them.
<br>We must value what we have, we must value what we're made for.
